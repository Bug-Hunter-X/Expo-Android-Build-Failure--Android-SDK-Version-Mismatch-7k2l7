This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android SDK version specified in your project's `gradle.properties` file and the version actually installed on your system.  The error message might not directly point to this, often manifesting as a build failure with vague error messages related to the Android build system. For example, you might encounter issues related to missing tools, or build process failures that don't provide a clear reason.
